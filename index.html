        </h2>
        <p>
          Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could
          improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start
          designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and
          stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge,
          something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many
          designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I
          really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just
          something nice and did not solve any problem.

              Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the
              frustration of the users and resolve to end it.

            <h3>Share and show your work</h3>
            <p>
              As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that's not
              finished or doesn't look perfect. You will learn to accept
              feedback and learn from it.
